# rblx-ouch
rblx-ouch is a program, programmed in Python that allows you to change the Roblox death sound to the original. I made this project so people can change the death sound faster.
Note: The creator of the "oof" sound may take down this project at any time. If you wish to take this project down, you may take it down.

# How do I use it?
To use rblx-ouch, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install rblx-ouch
2. Install: Python3
3. Install modules: os, shutil
4. After you installed rblx-ouch, run the file and type in the path to your ROBLOX. You can do this by: Right clicking on ROBLOX, Click on "Open File Location" and then navigate to the topbar, click "Copy Path"


# Notes:
Note 1: There isn't any set up file. I will try to make a set up file as soon as possible.
Note 2: There isn't any images, explaining how to use rblx-ouch. I will try to add images as soon as possible.
Note 3: After running rblx-ouch, there is a chance that you may encounter a warning from your device saying "This file might be a virus", even tho it's not. This warning might occurr because your device does not trust the file. Just click "Run Away" and you're all set.
